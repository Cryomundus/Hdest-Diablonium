// Most of these are server variables so in a multiplayer session they can be synced to other players.
// Every enemy has a comment before its cvars based on its name in-game for organization. - [Ted]

// NOTE: Values need to either be -1, 0, 2, 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 49, 99, 149 or 199 to work for the spawners!
// Anything else would require remaking the option values in the menus.
// They'll still function in-game correctly, but the menus won't properly display them.
// Stick to it please and have less bug reports to explain for pls. - [Ted]
